    "# Marketing Analytics: Social Network Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project involves analyzing a dataset of connections to identify key individuals for targeted marketing efforts. The goal is to optimize marketing strategies within a limited budget by focusing on influential nodes in a directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The dataset, `connections.txt`, is a list of edges representing connections between individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a Directed Graph\n",
    "- Use the provided data to construct a directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Identify Bridges\n",
    "- Identify and display nodes that act as bridges in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Graph Density\n",
    "- Calculate and show the density of the graph.\n",
    "- Comment on the findings based on the density measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Node Connections\n",
    "- Identify nodes with the highest and lowest number of connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Incoming and Outgoing Connections\n",
    "- Identify nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Centrality Measures\n",
    "- Calculate and display nodes with the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality.\n",
    "- Interpret the findings based on these centrality measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Community Detection\n",
    "- Implement a community detection algorithm on the directed graph.\n",
    "- Display the number of communities created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Largest and Smallest Community\n",
    "- Identify and display the largest and smallest communities.\n",
    "- Interpret findings based on community sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Top Three Communities\n",
    "- Select the largest three communities and draw them.\n",
    "- Remove the top three nodes with the highest centrality measures (Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector) for each community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Influencers of Top Three Communities\n",
    "- Draw the influencers of the top three communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Action Plan\n",
    "- Define a hypothetical business scenario (e.g., telecom, marketing agency).\n",
    "- Specify a hypothetical marketing budget and cost per action.\n",
    "- Determine target nodes based on the analysis.\n",
