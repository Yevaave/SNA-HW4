# Marketing Analytics: Social Network Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset of connections to identify key individuals for targeted marketing efforts. The goal is to optimize marketing strategies within a limited budget by focusing on influential nodes in a directed graph.

## Data
The dataset, `connections.txt`, is a list of edges representing connections between individuals.

## Tasks

### 1. Create a Directed Graph
- Use the provided data to construct a directed graph.

### 2. Identify Bridges
- Identify and display nodes that act as bridges in the graph.

### 3. Graph Density
- Calculate and show the density of the graph.
- Comment on the findings based on the density measure.

### 4. Node Connections
- Identify nodes with the highest and lowest number of connections.

### 5. Incoming and Outgoing Connections
- Identify nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections.

### 6. Centrality Measures
- Calculate and display nodes with the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality.
- Interpret the findings based on these centrality measures.

### 7. Community Detection
- Implement a community detection algorithm on the directed graph.
- Display the number of communities created.

### 8. Largest and Smallest Community
- Identify and display the largest and smallest communities.
- Interpret findings based on community sizes.

### 9. Top Three Communities
- Select the largest three communities and draw them.
- Remove the top three nodes with the highest centrality measures (Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector) for each community.

### 10. Influencers of Top Three Communities
- Draw the influencers of the top three communities.

### 11. Action Plan
- Define a hypothetical business scenario (e.g., telecom, marketing agency).
- Specify a hypothetical marketing budget and cost per action.
- Determine target nodes based on the analysis.
